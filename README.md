CUSTOM TYPOGRAPHY TAGS (e.g., H1, H2...) -- See typography.js -- This app uses familiar naming conventions for convenience in porting from web to mobile. React Native uses Text elements for all print. In typography.js, the native Text tag is modified with custom styles and exported as 'Text' for global use. Text components are then created for each text style commonly used (H1, H2, etc). This is where you will find the styles applied. Keep in mind that the modified Text component is used as the base for each.
